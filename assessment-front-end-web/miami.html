		<h1>South Beach Miami</h1>

		<h3>Miami is a lively colorful city by the sea. Here are a few things to do when you visit: </h3>

		<ul>
			<h4>Rent a bike</h4>
				<li>Hire a CitiBike and ride around the Art Deco buildings between 5th and 23rd Street. These buildings are so unique with their pastel color palletes and lush tropical gardens.</li>
			<h4>Go Stand Up Paddleboarding</h4>
				<li>There are plenty of spots to hire SUPs, but my favorite would be in Sunset Harbour. From the launching location you can quickly enter the canals that run behind the houses on Bay Road. These are really nice mansions!</li>
			<h4>Russian Baths</h4>
				<li>Even though it is about as hot as hell all year round, sweating it out in a Russian Bath just hits differently. So if you ever make it down, be sure to check them out. They don't have a website, just google the location! </li>
			<h4>Head to the Beach</h4>
				<li>I mean why wouldn't you? My recommendation is to go south of 5th Street. This part of the beach is more where the locals go. It's still packed, but with less riff-raff.</li>
			<h4>What not to do</h4>
				<li>Hire a Slingshot Car. Like please. Don't.</li>
		</ul>
